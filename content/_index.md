Welcome to my personal homepage. My name is Vicky Meng. During my time pursuing a Master's degree at the School of Finance at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, I found the research direction I am willing to explore for whole life - family economics and population, resource, and environmental economics. If these terms are too obscure, to put it more directly, it studies individuals from an economic perspective, enhancing their environmental contribution by understanding individual behaviors, and proposing effective policy measures. In addition, I am passionate about sports programs such as running, swimming, cycling (triathlon) and playing badminton. I persist in exercising my body besides studying and enjoy the sense of accomplishment after deep learning and sports.
