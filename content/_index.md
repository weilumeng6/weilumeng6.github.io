Welcome to my personal homepage. My name is Weilu (Vicky) Meng. During my pursuit of a master's degree at the School of Finance, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, I discovered the research directions I am passionate about and willing to explore throughout my life—labor economics and family economics. Labor economics enables me to delve into the labor market, understanding the variations in wages and employment opportunities. Family economics, on the other hand, allows me to gain better insights into resource allocation within families and the decision-making processes of family members. I aspire for my research to contribute to promoting social equity, addressing real-world societal issues, and providing a robust basis for the formulation of more effective policies and decisions.

Additionally, in my personal life, I have a strong passion for sports, including running, badminton, cycling, and swimming. These hobbies not only help me maintain physical health and fitness but also enhance my endurance and resilience. Sports serve as my means of relaxation and balancing my life, enabling me to better tackle academic and professional challenges. I believe that sports and academic research can complement each other, empowering me to address various challenges in different aspects of life.

欢迎来到我的个人主页。 我的名字叫孟维璐(Vicky Meng)。在中南财经政法大学金融学院攻读硕士学位期间，我找到了自己愿意一生去探索的研究方向——劳动经济学和家庭经济学。劳动经济学使我能够研究劳动力市场，了解工资和就业机会的变化，而家庭经济学则使我更好地理解家庭内资源分配和家庭成员的决策过程。我期望我的研究工作能够有助于促进社会公平、解决现实社会问题，并为制定更有效的政策和决策提供有力的依据。

此外，在生活中，我热衷于跑步、打羽毛球、骑行和游泳等体育项目。这些爱好不仅有助于保持健康和体能，还有助于提升我的耐力和坚韧精神。运动也是我放松和平衡生活的方式，让我更好地应对学术和职业挑战。我相信运动与学术研究可以相辅相成，促使我更好地应对各种生活领域的挑战。
