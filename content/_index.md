Welcome to my personal homepage. My name is Vicky Meng, and during my pursuit of a master's degree at the School of Finance at Central University of Finance and Economics, I discovered the research areas that I am passionate about and committed to exploring throughout my life—labor economics, environmental economics, and household economics.

Labor economics has allowed me to delve into the study of labor markets, gaining insights into wage dynamics and employment opportunities. Household economics has enhanced my understanding of resource allocation within households and the decision-making processes of family members. Environmental economics equips me with the tools to analyze the sustainability of environmental resources and to formulate policies aimed at addressing environmental challenges, such as climate change and natural resource management.

The knowledge and skills acquired in these three fields have empowered me to comprehensively comprehend and address a wide range of economic issues, spanning from the individual level to the societal level, and to understand their implications on our society and environment. I aspire for my research work to provide robust support for the sustainable development of our socio-economic system, offer valuable insights to policymakers on labor markets, family decision-making, and environmental concerns, and ultimately contribute to improving people's quality of life and safeguarding our environment.

Additionally, in my personal life, I have a strong passion for sports, including running, badminton, cycling, and swimming. These hobbies not only help me maintain physical health and fitness but also enhance my endurance and resilience. Sports serve as my means of relaxation and balancing my life, enabling me to better tackle academic and professional challenges. I believe that sports and academic research can complement each other, empowering me to address various challenges in different aspects of life.

欢迎来到我的个人主页。 我的名字叫孟维璐(Vicky Meng)。在中南财经政法大学金融学院攻读硕士学位期间，我找到了自己愿意一生去探索的研究方向——劳动经济学、环境经济学和家庭经济学。劳动经济学使我能够研究劳动力市场，了解工资和就业机会的变化；家庭经济学则使我更好地理解家庭内资源分配和家庭成员的决策过程；环境经济学能使我分析环境资源的可持续性，以及制定政策来解决环境问题，例如气候变化和自然资源管理。这三个领域的知识和工具有助于我更全面地理解和解决经济中的各种问题，从个体层面到社会层面，以及对我们的社会和环境产生的影响。我期望我的研究工作能够为社会经济的可持续发展提供有力支持，为政策制定者提供有关劳动市场、家庭决策和环境问题的重要见解，并最终为改善人们的生活质量和保护我们的环境做出贡献。

此外，在生活中，我热衷于跑步、打羽毛球、骑行和游泳等体育项目。这些爱好不仅有助于保持健康和体能，还有助于提升我的耐力和坚韧精神。运动也是我放松和平衡生活的方式，让我更好地应对学术和职业挑战。我相信运动与学术研究可以相辅相成，促使我更好地应对各种生活领域的挑战。
